## Bag of Holding - 
RPG Inventory Management Application.

## Problem : 
   In long-running RPG games it can be troublesome to track a player's inventory on pen and paper. It is also difficult for a game runner to keep up with what items each individual character has at any given time.

## Solution : 
   This app provides a single point of reference for storing a list of items, sorted by each character, and which party they belong to, allowing for fast reference.

## Capabilities : 
   Users can create a groups of parties: assign names and pictures to each party and member, add and delete items with reference to weight, value, quantity, and a reference to which book these items are detailed in.

## Future Release plans : 
   Wealth Tracker. Weight Management system. Party-Loot bag. Ability to swap items between characters.

## Technologies used :
